It predicts that <b>38 percent of all jobs</b> in the United States are \"at <b>high risk of automation</b>\" by the <b>early 2030s</b>.</p>\n\n    <Hero image={robotGirderWorkers} />\n\n    <p>Perhaps you think of <em>robots</em> replacing humans. That will surely be a reality, but for most of us, the greater threat is invisible; it's the synthetic human brain that Artificial Researchers have been working on for decades. How are they doing?</p>\n\n    <p>The U.S. Postal Service used to employ humans to read human handwriting in order to sort letters. No longer. In all but the rarest of cases, machines employing AI can read human handwriting and perform the sorting.</p>\n\n    <p>When Watson famously won at Jeopardy against the two best human players, it required a computer the size of a bedroom. That was in 2011. Now it can be done on a phone.</p>\n\n    <p> Last October, an Uber trucking subsidiary named Otto delivered 2,000 cases of Budweiser 120 miles from Fort Collins, Colorado, to Colorado Springs &mdash; without a driver at the wheel. Within a few years, this technology will go from prototype to full production: millions of truck drivers will be out of a job.</p>\n\n    <p>But you're probably not a postal worker, Jeopardy champion, or truck driver. Is your job safe? Economists group jobs into four broad categories:\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Routine physical</b>: digging ditches, driving trucks, forklift operators, heavy machine operators, welders, metal workers</li>\n        <li><b>Routine cognitive</b>: accounts-payable clerks, telephone sales, retail sales, administrative assistant, secretaries, bookkeepers, filing clerks, bank tellers</li>\n        <li><b>Nonroutine physical</b>: cooks, home health aide, janitors</li>\n        <li><b>Nonroutine cognitive</b>: teacher, doctor, radiologist, surgeon, CEO, public relations, financial analyst</li>\n      </ul>\n    </p>\n    <p>Most of the 38% of jobs that will be lost by the early 2030s will come from the first two groups: routine physical and routine cognitive. But the shift to artificial intelligence won't stop there.</p> \n    \n    <p>Already AI radiologists vastly outperform their human counterparts in identifying cancers. IBM's Watson, in addition to beating the two best Jeopardy champions in history, was recently given the same information that doctors had on 1000 patients. Watson gave the same diagnosis as the doctors did in over 99% of cases &mdash; and 30% of the time, provided further analysis that the doctors missed.\n      \n      Many sober analysts believe that by 2060, <b>every job will be done by AI/robots</b>.</p>\n\n    <p>Bill Gates and Elon Musk are both on record expressing grave concerns about what AI may mean for humans. Musk went so far as to say that AI represents a graver threat than nuclear weapons.</p>\n\n    <h2>This Time It's Different?</h2>\n\n    <p>But isn't all this a bit alarmist? This isn't the first time we've heard that machines were coming for our jobs. Why should we believe it's true this time?</p>\n\n    <p>Computing power is measured by how many calculations a chip can perform in one second, called a \"flop\". The best estimates are that our brains can process roughly 10 trillion flops a second. Recently, an IBM computer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory clocked in at 16.3 trillion flops/second.</p>\n\n    <p>Still, that supercomputer cost $250 million to build. Your employer isn't likely to spend that kind of money to replace you, right?</p>\n\n    <p>Suppose a genie appears to you on the first of December and offers you a choice: he'll give you a cool million dollars today -- or a single penny today &mdash; which he'll then double every day until the end of the month. Which should you take?</p>\n\n    <p>Let's say you figure the genie is probably a trickster and wants you to go for the easy million, but you decide to outsmart him and take the penny-doubling strategy. On December 2, he returns and gives you 2 cents, making your total 3 pennies. By December 15, you've only amassed $163.84. By December 20, you have a total of $5,242.88 and you're starting to think the genie actually did trick you. By Christmas, you've got a grand total of only $167,772.16. But the doubling continues and by the end of the month, you have a grand total of $10,737,418.24. <em>That's</em> what doubling looks like.</p>\n\n    <p>Since silicon computer chips were first invented, their processing power has doubled about every 18 months. This has been so remarkably consistent that it's referred to as \"Moore's Law\". And just like your experience with the genie, the returns have been relatively modest.</p>\n\n    <img src={doubling} class=\"aside\" alt=\"\"/>\n\n    <p>When critics suggest that the concern over AI is overblown, they're looking at their calendar, seeing that it's already December 25 and confidently telling us there's little cause for concern. But the graph shows what you found with the genie: doubling really pays off only at the tail end. <br /><br />It's Christmas alright, and someone is about to get an amazing present &mdash; but it won't be us.</p>\n\n    <p>With the increase of power from doubling, hardware designers will invent faster, more specialized chips. Google, for example, announced last spring that it had created a microchip called a Tensor Processing Unit, which was up to 30 times faster and 80 times more efficient for machine learning tasks than the Intel processor in your computer. Who will reap the benefits of robot/AI labor?</p>\n\n    <p>William Gibson, noted futurist, once famously stated: <em>The future is already here &mdash; it's just not very evenly distributed.</em> He's right. Those with the capital and foresight to see until the end of the month are investing heavily in both robotics and AI. And the strategy is paying off. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, has been perhaps the most aggressive in putting Amazon's profits into AI and automation. It's made him the world's richest person.</p>\n\n    <p>Andrew Yang, in his book, <em>The War on Normal People</em> points out that, in four years, 30% of American malls will be shut down. Amazon's low prices and fast delivery, driven by their enormous investment in both AI and robots, make it impossible for competitors who won't &mdash; or can't &mdash; make similar investments to survive. </p>\n\n    <p>But even if you accept Wang's contention that we are entering a time of unprecedented economic transformation, surely this brave new world will produce new jobs &mdash; jobs we haven't even imagined. Yes &mdash; and those new jobs will increasingly be done by our new AI overlords.</p>\n\n    <p>By the early 2030s unemployment begins to be an enormous problem. The scale and scope of the problem mean that it will take governments acting wisely and rapidly to solve the problem. Governments acting \"wisely and rapidly\"? I know...</p>\n\n    <p>Maybe now would be some time for some Good News?</p>\n\n  </div>\n);\n}\n\nexport default BadNews;","import React from 'react';\nimport Header from '../components/Header';\nimport noahsArk from '../images/noahs-ark.png';\nimport averageSalary from '../images/average-js-salary.jpg';\nimport currentJobs from '../images/current-jobs.png';\nimport salaryByState from '../images/salaries-by-state.png';\nimport styles from '../stylesheets/GoodNews.module.css';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst GoodNews = (props) => {\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"content\">\n      <Header />\n      <h1>Good News</h1>\n\n      <p><span className=\"dropcap\">I</span>n Charles Dickens' famous <em>Christmas Carol</em>, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Future, who shows him a bleak future. Horrified, Scrooge emplores the ghost to tell him that his fate is not sealed &mdash; that he may, \"by an altered life\", change that future.</p>\n\n      <p>In the movie, \"The Matrix\", Morpheus tells Neo:</p>\n\n      <blockquote><p className=\"quotation\">This is your last chance.

You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p></blockquote>\n\n      <p>The future outlined in the Bad News is certainly grim. But there is good news.</p>\n\n      <img src={noahsArk} alt=\"\"/>\n\n      <p>We can't do much about the large-scale, societal changes needed to deal with the oncoming wave of unemployment caused by robots and AI. But we can, like Noah, ensure that our families and we are safe.</p>\n\n      <img className={styles['average-salary']} src={averageSalary} alt=\"\"/>\n\n      <p>The modern-day Noah's Ark is computer programming. In 2018, the average salary for a JavaScript programmer in the United States was almost $111,000. If you're like most people unfamiliar with programming, you might well think that I'm suggesting something akin to becoming a professional golfer. Sure, it pays great, but this is not a job for ordinary people. You need deep math skills and, just maybe, something we might call \"the programming gene\". Whatever that is, you're pretty sure you don't have it.</p>\n\n      <p>We're going to get into how realistic becoming a programmer is for normal people in the <b>Me? Really?</b> section. For now, let's just explore why, apart from the salary, you might <em>want</em> to become a programmer.</p>\n\n      <h2>Job Security</h2>\n      <img src={currentJobs} alt=\"\" className=\"aside\"/>\n      <p>Computer programmers are in high demand. As a computer programmer, you'll be in the coveted position of having recruiters track you down. There are hundreds of thousands &mdash; perhaps as much as a million &mdash; unfilled openings for computer programmers. And demand keeps growing.</p>\n\n      <h2>Remote Work Opportunities</h2>\n      <p>Managers in the last century often wanted to see \"warm bodies in seats\" so they could make sure everyone was working! But the shortage of programmers meant that they had to be more flexible in their demands. As a result, they ended up employing many remote developers.</p>\n     \n      <p>In my last job, I managed a group of developers. All of them worked remotely (and all of them made well in excess of $100K...). A good friend of mine employs over 200 developers, all of whom work remotely.</p>\n\n      <p>Managers dragged into allowing remote work were astonished to find that employees were <em>more</em> productive when they worked from home. Now, it's becoming commonplace for companies to allow their developers to work remotely.</p>\n      \n      <h2>Formal Training is Seldom a Requirement</h2>\n      <p>Again, \"blame\" this on the shortage of programmers. Employers commonly dispense with requirements for formal education. They're looking for people who can code, not who have a degree.</p>\n\n      <p>Sadly, people interested in becoming a programmer are often told they need to attend a \"bootcamp\". These are intensive programs that purport to make you hiring-ready in 12-15 weeks. The cost? $12-20K. Some will offer you \"free\" training, getting their cut once you become a paid programmer where they can take as much of 30% of your salary for two years!</p>\n\n\n      <img src={salaryByState} alt=\"\" className=\"aside\"/>\n\n      <p>As someone who has hired many developers, I've interviewed some of these bootcamp graduates. I hesitate to paint with too broad a brush, but in my experience, these graduates' knowledge is broad, but very shallow. I've never hired any of them.</p>\n   \n      <h2>The Work is Fun!</h2>\n      <p>I'll understand if you think I've slipped my mental moorings, but ask any working developer and they'll tell you that coding is highly creative. In fact, it's the rare developer who doesn't code in their off-hours, sheerly for the enjoyment of it.</p>\n\n      <h2>Become AI-Proof</h2>\n      <p>Well, this one comes with a caveat. By 2060, it's almost certain that most programming jobs will be done by machines. But that provides you with a very long runway, during which time (hopefully) governments will have figured out how to deal with massive unemployment.</p>\n\n      <h2>A Progammer. Me?</h2>\n      <p>Believe me, I understand your skepticism. So let's head over to <b><Link to=\"/really\">Me? Really?</Link></b> to see if I can convince you that you actually do have what you need to become a successful, professional programmer.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default GoodNews;  ","import React from 'react';\nimport Header from '../components/Header';\nimport styles from '../stylesheets/Really.module.css';\n\nconst Really = (props) => {\n\n  return (\n     <div className=\"content\">\n      <Header />\n      <h1>Me? Really?</h1>\n      <p><span className=\"dropcap\">I</span> know what you're thinking. \"<em>There is no way I could become a programmer.</em>\" Imagine that you are transported back to the Middle Ages. Like most people, you're an illiterate peasant. One day, someone approaches you and tells you that they can teach you to read.</p>\n\n      <p>What's your reaction? It's probably <q>That's <i>ridiculous</i>!</q> Reading is only for very smart people, people who have a very special innate ability. Fast forward a few hundred years and it turns out that virtually everyone can be taught to read. No special genius or \"reading gene\" is required.</p>\n      \n      <p>Still, I understand that the notion of <i>you</i> becoming a professional programmer just seems so...unlikely. OK, let's explore why you might think that.</p>\n\n      <p><span class={styles.objection}>I'm not smart enough.</span> I hear that <em>a lot</em>. You probably don't think you're <b>dumb</b>. It's just that to be a programmer, you have to be super-smart, right? There <em>are</em> some super-smart programmers &mdash; people like Linus Torvalds who wrote an entire operating system (Linux). I know those people exist, but in thirty years of programming, I've never worked with any of them. The truth is you just have to be smart <em>enough</em>. How smart is enough? That's what the Exercises are designed to help you find out.</p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>I'm not good at math.</span> You, too? No, seriously, my background is in woodworking. Want to know a secret? The great majority of math that programmers do is basic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. The super-smart programmers? Yeah, they do crazy math. All the rest of us? Not really.</p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>I'm a creative person.</span> You are? That's fantastic because programming is highly creative. No, it typically doesn't involve drawing, painting, sculpting, <em>etc.</em> but it's highly mentally stimulating. In fact, virtually all programmers would agree with me when I say that programming is just plain fun.</p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>I can't take 2 years to go back to school to get a degree.</span> Very few people can. And, really? Even if you had the time/money for that, I would encourage you <em>not</em> to do so. There are much better, faster, and cheaper ways to make the transition &mdash; and they don't require you to quit your current job.</p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>I'm right-brained.</span> Oh, well, if that's the case... But, just to make sure, let me ask you a few questions: \n      <ul className=\"\">\n        <li>Can you read?</li>\n        <li>Can you make a to-do list?</li>\n        <li>Do you know how much 3+ 4 is?</li>\n        <li>Can you follow a recipe?</li>\n      </ul>\n        I'm taking a wild guess here that you answered \"yes\" to all those? Well, then you're not <em>really</em> right-brained, as all those activities are left-brained. The whole idea that people are either left-brained or right-brained was debunked years ago. It's junk science. We have two hemispheres that control different activities &mdash; and we go back and forth between them effortlessly. Do some people have more of an affinity for activities associated with the right hemisphere? Sure, but that doesn't preclude you from employing the left hemisphere when you need to.</p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>Typing all day? No thanks!</span> I've got news for you: programmers don't type all day. We talk with other people, we plan, we use Google (a lot!). The actual amount of typing is quite small. </p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>I'm too old to learn to program.</span> Ageism is real. The programming world isn't free of it. But in an environment where finding talent is rare, only a very stupid manager would exclude <em>any</em> person who can code. Are there some of those stupid managers out there? Sure &mdash; but you don't want to work for them anyway. There's plenty of smart managers who are looking for good people at any age.</p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>I don't have a good memory. I can't memorize all that syntax.</span> I hate to blow the whistle on my fellow programmers, but most of us don't have an encyclopedic memory either. Here's what things look like in real life: \"Huh, I have to do <em>x</em>. I can't remember how to do <em>x</em>. Say, Google...\"</p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>I don't type very quickly.</span>  You don't need to. In fact, in interviewing many, many candidates, it's never even occurred to me to ask how quickly they type.</p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>I'm a woman and I know programming is a male profession.</span> Do I have news for you! First, yes, programming is predominantly male. Employers (and shareholders) know this too &mdash; and they desperately want to change it. That means that if you're female, you will (a) move to the top of the candidate list and (b) command a higher salary. If you're a woman who's used to pervasive sexism, you might think I'm lying about this point. I'm not.</p>\n\n      <p><span className={styles.objection}>The idea of becoming a programmer is scary!</span> Sure, it is! That's OK. It's a big change. What you need is a good teacher/mentor. More about that later...</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Really; ","const exerciseList = [{\n    number: 0,\n    video: '72a4HUW3FsQ',\n    code: 'https://repl.it/@halbhelms/Exercise-0',\n

They will teach you the basics of the three technologies in becoming a JavaScript programmer: <b>HTM, CSS, and JavaScript</b> itself.</p>\n\n    <p>Why a JavaScript programmer (as opposed to the many other languages you might learn)? JavaScript programmers (also called <em>front-end</em> programmers are in <b>high demand</b>, the <b>pay is excellent</b>, and &mdash; perhaps most importantly &mdash; JavaScript programming is the <b>easiest to learn</b>.</p>\n\n    <p>Each exercise comes in three parts:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>Introductory video</b>: a short video that introduces the exercise</li>\n      <li><b>Explanation &amp; Instructions</b>: a PDF that explains the exercise and provides instructions on how to complete it</li>\n      <li><b>Link to code</b>: a link to starter code you'll use to complete the exercise.

Each exercise can take between 20-45 minutes to complete, but if you really want to explore whether being a professional coder is realistic for you, I strongly encourage you to go through all of them.</p>\n\n    <p>When you're ready to go pro, join me at <a href=\"codingcareer.org\" target=\"newwin\">codingcareer.org</a> and explore the options available to you in my <b>CareerChanger</b> professional programming course.</p>\n    \n    <div className={styles.exercise}>\n      <p>This short video explains how to set up and use a free account at repl.it, which you'll need to complete the exercises. </p>\n      <div><iframe title=\"using-a-repl\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-qjTcV-Eh0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div className={styles.exercise}>\n      <p>This video explains how to set up and use VS Code. </p>\n      <div><iframe title=\"Getting set up with VS Code\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PXsKMi0fvu4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    {listOfExercises}\n    \n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Exercises;","import React from 'react';\nimport Header from '../components/Header';\n\nconst AboutMe = (props) => {\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"content\">\n    <Header />\n    <h1>About Me</h1>\n\n    <p><span className=\"dropcap\">M</span>y name is Hal Helms. I've been programming professionally for almost thirty years. For much of that time, I've been involved in teaching other programmers.</p>\n\n    <p>Like you, I approached programming by a very unlikely route, studying theology for one year in college, then working as a woodworker for almost ten years. From both my own experience, and that of thousands of students I've taught, I have learned that programming is much more of a <i>mindset</i> than mere memorization of arcane syntax.</p>\n\n    <p>I believe the discipline of programming has helped me in other areas, sharpening my thinking and problem-solving. And while the popular misconception is that programming is the domain of near genius-level intellects, almost all of the programmers I've had the pleasure of working with, and teaching, are quite normal people. What we might call the \"programmer mindset\" (and, yes, the arcane syntax) can be be learned.</p>\n\n    <p>Because I am deeply concerned about what I perceive as the pernicious effects of automation and AI, I hope to convince as many people as I can that, for the next several decades, programming is likely to represent a safe haven from the oncoming storm.</p>\n\n    <p>Moore's Law (the computing power of the tiny chips that power so many of our devices doubles every 18 months) will fuel an enormous increase in the ability of machines to do the work now reserved for humans.</p>\n\n    <p>As more people look to programming as a way to delay the effects of what is arguably the greatest ever transformation in world economies, there will be no shortage of unscrupulous companies ready to exploit people's anxiety. Already, people are being sold on the idea that <i>in 4 short months</i> (at the cost of thousands of dollars), the programming world will open to them.</p> \n    \n    <p>One prestigious university in Florida joined with a \"programming bootcamp\" promising a rosy future for only $14,000. Still others promise to teach you for free &mdash; in return for a claim on future earnings that can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. On the other end of the spectrum, I recently saw that CNN was advertising a course that promised to teach you <i>everything</i> for the low cost of $49. As I said, there will be no shortage of companies wishing to take advantage of those who want a better life but lack the knowledge of how to approach such a career change.</p>\n\n    <p>I hope you'll take advantage of these exercises to explore whether <i>you</i> might want to consider it as a new career. If you do, there are a number of possible onroads to the world of programming. I am creating an online <b>CareerChanger</b> course bolstered by one-on-one and group mentoring of students. You can check out the options available at <a href=\"http://codingcareer.org\" target=\"newwin\">codingcareer.org</a>.</p>\n\n    <p>For students who wish to navigate the path alone, there are many free resources as well, some of which are excellent in teaching you the syntax of programming. I'll include links to these at <a href=\"http://codingcareer.org\" target=\"newwin\">codingcareer.org</a>. Whichever course you take, I wish you only the best. I only urge you to act soon.

Then, I'm going to further try to convince you that there's some really <Link to=\"/goodnews\"><b>good news</b></Link>. </p>\n\n    <p>I've been a professional programmer for close to thirty years. I've taught programming to thousands of people through books, in-person training, and magazine articles. Most of these people did not have degrees in computer science or software engineering.</p>\n\n    <p>One of my first students was a young man named Aaron. When I met him, he had only recently left his job as a pizza-delivery person. He had no technical training, but I saw potential in Aaron. I told him that if he followed my lead, I would teach him the skills needed to be a professional developer. He did &mdash; and he currently works as a technical lead (programmer) making in excess of $115K.</p>\n\n    <p>Wes was an usher at an AMC movie theater. He had no idea what he wanted to do with his life when his Mom asked me to talk with him. I told Wes that if he would let me, I would help him become a professional software developer. He did &mdash; and he just left a job paying him $110K <i>for a higher-paying job</i>.</p>\n\n    <p>I'm currently working with two women who are well on their way to getting their first jobs in programming. (They are the inspiration for one of the exercises involving custom t-shirts with the cheeky slogan emblazoned: <b>I'm a female coder. Try to keep up.)</b></p>\n\n    <p>I convinced them &mdash; <b>but can I convince you?</b></p>\n\n    <div className={styles['q']}>\n    <q>Because of self-doubt, the fear of failure, or laziness, most people usually bite off way less than they can chew.</q> <i>&mdash;Mokokoma Mokhonoana</i>\n    </div>\n\n    <p>If you're like most of us, you probably think that the idea of becoming a professional programmer is <i>outrageous</i>! You're no good a math. You're not \"technical\". And you probably think you're not smart enough.</p>\n\n    <p>My route to becoming a professional programmer was...circuitous. In the only year of college I completed, I studied theology. That naturally led to a career in woodworking? I really stumbled into programming and I'm grateful that I knew a programming manager who took a chance and hired me when I knew absolutely nothing.</p>\n\n    <p>I learned that programming isn't a natural talent like singing or drawing. It's a skill &mdash; a way of <i>thinking</i> really &mdash; that can be learned.</p>\n\n    <p>But that probably isn't <i>nearly</i> enough to convince you. Maybe Aaron and Wes and I all had a recessive \"programming gene\" that just hadn't come to the fore yet. Maybe, despite none of us being particularly good at math, we had some nascent genius that only needed the right environment to express itself?</p>\n\n    <p>Rather than try to convince you otherwise, I'm offering you <Link to=\"/exercises\"><b>60 exercises</b></Link> to help <i>you</i> decide. They're all free. These aren't quizzes. They're actual coding exercises. They start simply and move up in complexity. Most importantly, they'll let you experience what it's like to be a programmer. They'll take you between 20 and 45 minutes to complete each one and there are answers provided if you really get stuck.</p>\n\n    <p>But before you make up your mind, I've got <Link to=\"/badnews\"><b>reasons</b></Link> that will help explain why I'm standing on this soapbox crying \"The End is Nigh!\"</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Home;","import React from 'react';\nimport { Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport BadNews from './pages/BadNews';\nimport GoodNews from './pages/GoodNews';\nimport Really from './pages/Really';\nimport Exercises from './pages/Exercises';\nimport AboutMe from './pages/AboutMe';\nimport Home from './pages/Home';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"app\">\n      <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\n      <Route path=\"/badnews\" component={BadNews} />\n      <Route path=\"/goodnews\" component={GoodNews} />\n      <Route path=\"/really\" component={Really} />\n      <Route path=\"/exercises\" component={Exercises} />\n      <Route path=\"/aboutme\" component={AboutMe} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;","import React from 'react';\nimport App from './App';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst Root = () => {\n  return (\n    <Router basename=\"/\">\n      <App />\n    </Router>);\n}\n\nexport default Root;","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
